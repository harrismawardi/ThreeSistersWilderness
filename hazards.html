        <p>Volcanic hazards in the Three Sisters region include eruption-triggered events such as tephra fall, pyroclastic flows, lava flows, lahars and flooding, as well as landslides from steep flanks, which need not be triggered by eruptions. Hazard zones that follow river valleys for tens of kilometers downstream from Three Sisters could be inundated by lahars generated either by melting of snow and ice during eruptions or by large landslides. Slow-moving lava flows could issue from new volcanic vents in the region surrounding the Three Sisters cluster. Fallout of tephra from eruption clouds can affect areas hundreds of kilometers downwind, so eruptions at volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascade Range also contribute to volcano hazards in Central Oregon. Rapidly developing communities in Deschutes County to the east, plus several small communities to the west, are at the greatest risk for impact from volcanic hazards.Neither North nor Middle Sister is likely to resume volcanic activity.[62] An eruption from South Sister would pose a threat to nearby life, as the proximal danger zone extends 1.2 to 6.2 miles (2 to 10 km) from the volcano's summits. During an eruption, tephra could accumulate to 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm) in the city of Bend, and mudflows and pyroclastic flows could run down the sides of the mountain, threatening any life in their paths. Eruptions from South Sister could be either explosive or effusive, though an eruption of ash with local volcanic rock accumulation and slow lava flows is considered most likely. The Three Sisters area does not have fumarole activity, although there are hot springs west of South Sister.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>When the first geological reconnaissance of the Three Sisters region was published in 1925, its author, Edwin T. Hodge, suggested that the Three Sisters and five smaller mountains in the present-day wilderness area were the remains of an enormous collapsed volcano that had been active during the Miocene or early Pliocene epochs. Naming this ancient volcano Mount Multnomah, Hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a caldera just as Mount Mazama collapsed to form Crater Lake.</p>
