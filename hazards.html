    <h2>Hazards</h2>
    <div class="box">

      <p>Volcanic hazards in the Three Sisters region include eruption-triggered events such as tephra fall, pyroclastic
        flows, lava flows, lahars and flooding, as well as landslides from steep flanks, which need not be triggered by
        eruptions. Hazard zones that follow river valleys for tens of kilometers downstream from Three Sisters could be
        inundated by lahars generated either by melting of snow and ice during eruptions or by large landslides.
        Slow-moving lava flows could issue from new volcanic vents in the region surrounding the Three Sisters cluster.
        Fallout of tephra from eruption clouds can affect areas hundreds of kilometers downwind, so eruptions at
        volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascade Range also contribute to volcano hazards in Central Oregon. Rapidly
        developing communities in Deschutes County to the east, plus several small communities to the west, are at the
        greatest risk for impact from volcanic hazards.Neither North nor Middle Sister is likely to resume volcanic
        activity.[62] An eruption from South Sister would pose a threat to nearby life, as the proximal danger zone
        extends 1.2 to 6.2 miles (2 to 10 km) from the volcano's summits. During an eruption, tephra could accumulate to
        1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm) in the city of Bend, and mudflows and pyroclastic flows could run down the sides of
        the mountain, threatening any life in their paths. Eruptions from South Sister could be either explosive or
        effusive, though an eruption of ash with local volcanic rock accumulation and slow lava flows is considered most
        likely. The Three Sisters area does not have fumarole activity, although there are hot springs west of South
        Sister.</p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>When the first geological reconnaissance of the Three Sisters region was published in 1925, its author, Edwin
        T. Hodge, suggested that the Three Sisters and five smaller mountains in the present-day wilderness area were
        the remains of an enormous collapsed volcano that had been active during the Miocene or early Pliocene epochs.
        Naming this ancient volcano Mount Multnomah, Hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a caldera just as
        Mount Mazama collapsed to form Crater Lake.</p>
